# Decorator Validation

A TypeScript decorator-driven validation and model framework. It lets you:
- Define validation rules with declarative decorators on model properties (e.g., @required, @min, @pattern).
- Build, validate, serialize, and hash models with pluggable registries and algorithms.
- Extend validation via a registry of Validator classes and utilities.
- Optionally expose validation as MCP tools for automation workflows.
